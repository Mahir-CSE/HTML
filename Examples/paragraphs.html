            This paragraph
            contains      a lot of spaces
            in the source     code,
            but the    browser 
            ignores it.

    <span>
        <p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
    </span>

    <span>
        <p>The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks:</p>

        <pre>
            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

            My Bonnie lies over the sea.

            My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
            
            Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
