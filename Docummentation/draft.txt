1. HTML Styles:
    a. Syntax: <tagname style="property:value;">
    b. Syntax (multiple): <tagname style="property:value; property:value; property:value;"
    c. Example: <h3 style="color: darkslategray; text-align: center; font-family: sans-serif;">Mahir Ahmed Niloy</h3>
    d. topics covered:
        # Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
        # Use background-color for background color
        # Use color for text colors
        # Use font-family for text fonts
        # Use font-size for text sizes
        # Use text-align for text alignment

2. HTML Formatting:
    a. <b> - Bold text
    b. <strong> - Important text
    c. <i> - Italic text
    d. <em> - Emphasized text
    e. <mark> - Marked text
    f. <small> - Smaller text
    g. <del> - Deleted text
    h. <ins> - Inserted text
    i. <sub> - Subscript text
    j. <sup> - Superscript text

    Use case of HTML formatting elements:
    <b> - Bold
        Why it exists: To make text visually stand out without implying it's more important than surrounding text. Just visual styling.
        Problem it solves: Sometimes you need text to look different for readability or design, but it's not actually "important" - like making a keyword easy to spot or styling a UI element.
    <strong> - Important
        Why it exists: To tell browsers, screen readers, and search engines "this text is critically important."
        Problem it solves: Blind users need to know what's important. A screen reader can change its tone or volume for <strong> text. Also helps search engines understand key points in your content.
    <i> - Italic
        Why it exists: To follow typographic conventions where certain text should be styled differently by tradition.
        Problem it solves: In writing, we italicize ship names, foreign words, book titles, etc. This is just following standard publishing rules without adding semantic meaning.
    <em> - Emphasized
        Why it exists: To represent how you'd say something with vocal stress or emphasis.
        Problem it solves: Screen readers can add vocal stress when reading <em> text, so "I really mean it" sounds different than "I really mean it" - just like in speech.
    <mark> - Highlighted
        Why it exists: To show text that's relevant to the current context or user's action.
        Problem it solves: When you search for "apple" on a page, the word needs to be highlighted so you can find it quickly. Like using a highlighter pen on paper.
    <small> - Smaller Text
        Why it exists: To show text that's less important or supplementary, like legal fine print.
        Problem it solves: Some text needs to be there legally or for completeness, but shouldn't distract from the main content. Visually de-emphasizes it.
    <del> - Deleted
        Why it exists: To show that content has been removed while keeping it visible for context.
        Problem it solves: In document editing, price changes, or to-do lists, you want to show what was there but is no longer valid. Better than just erasing it because readers can see the history.
    <ins> - Inserted
        Why it exists: To show that content has been added or updated.
        Problem it solves: When you update a document, readers need to know what's new. In legal documents or collaborative editing, tracking insertions is crucial for transparency.
    <sub> - Subscript
        Why it exists: To properly display scientific, mathematical, and technical notation.
        Problem it solves: You can't write "H2O" in regular text and have it look correct. The "2" needs to be lower and smaller to match scientific conventions. Essential for chemistry, math, and technical docs.
    <sup> - Superscript
        Why it exists: To display exponents, ordinals, footnotes, and trademark symbols correctly.
        Problem it solves: "E=mc2" looks wrong - it needs to be "E=mc²". Mathematical formulas, footnote references, and trademark symbols require proper superscript formatting to be readable and correct.

3. HTML Links - The target Attribute
    By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

    The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

    The target attribute can have one of the following values:

        _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
        _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
        _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
        _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

4. HTML quotations:

    a. <abbr> - Defines an abbreviation or acronym

        html
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>

            Why use it: Provides the full form of abbreviations for accessibility and clarity. Screen readers can announce the full text, and browsers typically show the title on hover.

            Use case: Technical documentation, articles with acronyms (NASA, FBI, API), or any abbreviated terms that need explanation.

    b. <address> - Defines contact information

        html
        <address>Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@example.com">info@example.com</a></address>
            Why use it: Semantically marks contact information, helping search engines and assistive technologies identify it as such. Usually displayed in italics by default.

            Use case: Footer sections, author contact details, business addresses, or email information at the end of articles.

    c.<bdo> - Defines text direction

        html
        <bdo dir="rtl">This text will be displayed right-to-left</bdo>
            Why use it: Overrides the current text direction, useful for mixing languages with different reading directions (like Arabic or Hebrew with English).

            Use case: Multilingual websites, displaying right-to-left languages within left-to-right content, or creating special text effects.

    d. <blockquote> - Defines a quoted section

        html
        <blockquote cite="https://example.com">This is a longer quotation from another source.</blockquote>
            Why use it: Semantically indicates that content is a quotation from an external source. Browsers typically indent it, and it improves SEO and accessibility.

            Use case: Blog posts with quotes, testimonials, citing sources, or displaying excerpts from other documents.

    e.<cite> - Defines the title of a work

        html
        <p>My favorite book is <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite> by F. Scott Fitzgerald.</p>
            Why use it: Marks titles of creative works (books, movies, songs, paintings) for semantic meaning. Usually displayed in italics.

            Use case: References to books, articles, films, songs, or any creative work titles in content.

    f.<q> - Defines a short inline quotation

        html
        <p>He said, <q>The early bird catches the worm.</q></p>
            Why use it: For short, inline quotations (browsers automatically add quotation marks around the text). More semantic than just using regular quotation marks.

            Use case: Short quotes within paragraphs, dialogue snippets, or brief cited phrases that don't need a separate block.
